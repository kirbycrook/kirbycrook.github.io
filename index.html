							</div>
							<div class="cardcontent">
								<p>The inspiration for the HomeAway app came out of a design sprint that took place in the Startup Instuitute course. Our goal was to take something from ideation, through the user testing phase, and into a high fidelity mockup. My app, HomeAway, is the AirBnB of all things travel related. Travelers now have access to everything they may need without the hassle of packing it all with them. Lendors make money renting out items that previously were simply taking up space when not being used. Whether it's a bike in Copenhagen or a pair of skis in Vail, HomeAway provides a platform to connect lendors and renters all across the world. </p>

									<img class="cardimg2" src="img1/homeaway/ha2.jpg"></img>
									</div>
								</div>	
								<p>The design sprint was done individually, so I took the concept through the entire design process. I began with a Who-Do chart to determine who I thought would be the various customer segments, and how they would act. I came up with three users with three different motivations. The information I had compiled in the chart was influenced by either assumptions or facts; my next step was to lay out a number of assumptions, facts, and questions that were associated with what I had so far. I then developed a problem statement and narrowed my target market down to a single user persona. With a more concrete idea of who my user would be, I started sketching, wireframing, and developing a user flow. </p>

									<div>
									<img class="cardimg" src="img1/homeaway/Group 20.jpg"></img>
									</div>
								</div>	
								<p>As I moved to more hi-fi mockups, I had a number of goals in mind that were influencing my decisions. Traveling can sometimes be a hassle; I wanted to make the user experience as low-stress and fluid as possible. Allowing a viewer to search for equipment prior to logging in or signing up gives him or her the chance to see the inventory with minimal click-thrus. I took a mobile-first design approach; due to the array of features that could be included, designing mobile first allowed me to assess the most pertinant features and progressively enhance as the screen size increased. A more in depth user flow can be seen and tested with the following Invision link below<a href="https://invis.io/236WCAVV7" target="_blank">https://invis.io/236WCAVV7</a></p>

							</div>
							<div class="cardcontent">
								<p>G-Ride is an eco-friendly ride sharing application that aims at raising global eco-consciousness and lowering the carbon footprint. Their message was fairly clear, but the delivery was not effective. The current version of the site can be seen below <a href="http://www.gogride.com" target="_blank">www.gogride.com</a></p>

								<p>The lack of brand identity led me to develop a logo, consistent style, and color scheme for the webpage. I referenced G-Ride's current site for necessary materials, content, and pages in order to develop a user flow. I created a logo that would give the viewer a basic understanding of the business, even without surrounding context. The typeface reflects the innovative, modernistic brand that G-Ride is hoping to develop. </p>

								<p>The site is currently being used to collect the information of prospective users and raise brand awareness; with that in mind, I prioritized the call to action on multiple pages, and reduced the clutter of the home page. The resulting webpage is one that has strong brand identity, streamlines the user experience, and establishes a consistency that was previously missing. </p>

							</div>
							<div class="cardcontent">
								<p>Guard Llama was created to help prevent violent physical and sexual assaults. Itâ€™s a complete personal security solution that arms our users with a handheld remote to immediately and discreetly send their emergency profile and GPS location to the nearest police dispatch center. This approach allows our users to keep their phones completely out of sight, minimizing the time and danger associated with a traditional 9Â­1Â­1 call, especially when an attacker has the element
								of surprise, or even worse Â­ your trust. The result is a drastically increased response time, and in turn a safer environment for all.
								One of the approaches weâ€™ve used to grow our business is developing a reseller program, whereby users and fans of our service can earn discounts and commissions by getting others to sign up. This tactic is working, but the whole process lacks structure. What we need is an attractive and functional online portal to organize and improve the reselling process for these outside sales partners.</p>

									<div>
									<img class="cardimg" src="img1/guardllamas/gl4.jpg"></img>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>Our vision is that the portal will be used for access to sales materials, competitive analysis, FAQs, and more. Also, we envision it serving as a sales dashboard for the resellers to track their sales made, commissions earned, and other metrics that may be important to them. We
								feel a robust reseller portal will result in more reseller relationships created, more commissions earned for the resellers, and more revenue for us.</p>

								<p>Our team was made up of two designers and two developers. As designers, we started with developing a visual representation of the brand through a style guide. In collaborating with the developers, we were able to diagram a user flow and the necessary pages for the website to function as a version 1. We worked within the already-established brand constraints, as well as the limits of what our developers felt comfortable doing. In order to deliver on the requirements from a backend standpoint, our team felt it necessary to use Wordpress. Without any prior training or knowledge of Wordpress, we were forced to alter our original designs to fit within the theme we used.</p>

To achieve our mission and ultimate vision, weâ€™re taking a technology-first approach by building out our online platform, the Ecosystem Network. It will help connect individuals in the black tech community with each other and with vital information and resources to successfully navigate the Chicago tech ecosystem.

								<p>The task for the group is as follows: on our development team weâ€™re currently lacking UI/UX design skills. Weâ€™d like some guidance on how we should design the interface and structure the user experience of our platform to make it as user-friendly and helpful as possible. Once the platformâ€™s ready to go, we need a killer marketing plan for attracting and onboarding users. This includes converting our existing community over to the platform, as well as bringing in new people who arenâ€™t yet familiar with us.</p>

								<p>With five teams working on the same project, we decided to take a bold approach to the project in hopes of generating new ideas and concepts for the BTM team. We decided to get rid of the traditional news feed and replace it with a cover flow of connections, events, and job opportunities in order to reflect the experience of a community. We decided that a cluttered news feed may just turn into 'another Facebook', which is what we wanted to avoid. In 24 hours, we developed a hi-fi mockup of a simple user flow from login to a person's profile.</p>
